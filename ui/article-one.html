<h3>Have you ever met him ?</h3>
<div>-by sujata</div>

<p>"Have you ever met him",The world always asked ..<br>
Is it required,She always answered  but to herself.</p>


<p>Noisy canteen,some nostalgic stories and this is how it started..<br>
There's something in this face,she remarks<br>
He's my brother,friend replied.<br>
With a smile on her face and some clingy thoughts in her mind ..<br>
Request was send..<br>
To the surprise,it was accepted even faster than was sent</p>

<p>Serious disgnosis of the profile went for hours..<br>
The smile or precisely the dimples, got her closer<br>
Many hours were spent talking with the pictures..<br>
"When in doubt,wear red"was his caption<br>
And She read it innmuerable times..<br>
She felt,She was overthinking and suddenly..</p>

<p>A message on insta popped..<br>
Her joy knew no bounds.<br>
Notifications used to give her utmost happiness<br>
Continuous chats,turned aquaintance to friendship..<br>
She waited hours in night just to see a blue heart on her screen..<br>
And it was her first serious crush,She accepted.</p>

<p>He assured her,a special friendship and<br>
She said She was happy..<br>
A lot of thoughts drove her away<br>
But his charm brought her closer<br>
And closer..<br>
Why can't He feel the same?,was her question to herself..</p>

<p>Weekly calls were soon promoted to daily<br>
Minutes soon turned into hours..<br>
And crush...to love.<br>
Her life was full of special feeling of love,<br>
She was pampered by all..<br>
But She desired to be cared by only one.</p>

<p>Several attempts were made to move on
Only if blocking would be a way to avoid,He would have left long back..
Both needed each other 
May be just to share their talks..their stories..their laughter
What matters was the need.
The need of her for him and 
his for her..</p>

<p>She soon found her bestfriend in him
And tried her best, to be his favourite listener
At all times..
But destiny had decided something, 
More happening,More adventurous.</p>

<p>Nothing comes before family,were her words.
We belong to good families,were his.
And separation was decided..
Of two true souls,"never met".
One last question was the angel's plan
He asked"Have you moved on?"
Yes,and mere silence.</p>

<p>What came next was not less than a miracle for her
He accepted his feelings for her..the love..the care..the sorrow of gettting separated
She couldn't lie anymore and 
Both felt a virtual hug,He felt his heart was light,She felt She heard everything She always wanted.
But the question still stayed firm for her
"Have you ever met him?"
"It matters no more"she answeres now..</p>
